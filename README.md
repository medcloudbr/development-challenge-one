# Development challenge
Medcloud's challenge for the back-end developer positions.

## Problem
We need a simple Java program that saves a collection of patients  (Patient's name, birth date, email and address) in a database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc) and right after, perform a select on these data and save the results on a xml file. 

The patient address should be saved by entering the CEP of the patient and retrieving the full address by Correios Web Service. 

After saving the file in .xml, read this xml file again, obtain the patient's name from this file, and finally proceed with the replication of this data + the epoch timestamp in a 2nd database, different from the 1st transaction.

## Delivery
You can email your code to cv@medcloud.com.br or deliver it through a private GitHub repository.
Good luck! Any doubts, feel free to send an email to cv@medcloud.com.br.
